# Healthcare, Lifestyle, and Addiction Indicators Analysis using Power BI & Excel

# Overview
This project analyzes the relationship between demographic factors, lifestyle behaviors, mental health indicators, and addiction-related outcomes using Power BI. The goal is to identify population-level patterns that can support healthcare providers, addiction counselors, and public health decision-makers in identifying high-risk groups and intervention opportunities.

# Dataset
The analysis uses a publicly available Kaggle dataset containing information on 3,000 individuals, including:
* Demographics (age, gender, marital status, employment)
* Lifestyle factors (exercise frequency, diet quality, BMI)
* Mental health and social support indicators
* Substance use behaviors (drinks per week, cigarettes per day)
* Attempts to quit smoking and drinking

# Tools & Technologies

* Power BI (data modeling, DAX, interactive dashboards)
* Excel (data cleaning and preprocessing)

# Key Dashboards & Visuals

* Impact of social support on mental health outcomes
* Relationship between BMI and alcohol consumption
* Exercise habits by diet quality and gender
* Substance use patterns and quit attempt trends
* Demographic breakdowns with interactive slicers

# Key Insights

* Individuals with weaker social support show poorer mental health outcomes, highlighting the importance of social networks in addiction prevention.
* Healthier lifestyle behaviors (good diet and frequent exercise) tend to cluster together.
* Higher alcohol consumption is associated with increased attempts to quit, suggesting cycles of dependency.
* BMI shows a mild upward trend with alcohol consumption, indicating potential lifestyle risk patterns.

# Business & Healthcare Relevance
This dashboard demonstrates how healthcare analytics can be used to:

* Identify high-risk populations
* Support intervention planning
* Improve experience-focused and data-driven decision-making in healthcare systems
